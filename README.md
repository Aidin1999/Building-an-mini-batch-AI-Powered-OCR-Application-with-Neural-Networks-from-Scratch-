# Mini-Batch AI-Powered OCR Application with Neural Networks

This project implements an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) application using a custom-built neural network from scratch with NumPy and a comparative model using TensorFlow.

## Overview

The notebook titled **"Building a Mini-Batch AI-Powered OCR Application with Neural Networks from Scratch: NumPy vs TensorFlow"** includes:

- Construction of a neural network using only NumPy
- Implementation of mini-batch gradient descent for training
- Accuracy and loss tracking during training
- Regularization and learning rate decay
- Comparative evaluation using a similar model built in TensorFlow

## Goals

- Understand the inner workings of neural networks by building from scratch
- Compare performance and simplicity between manual implementation and high-level frameworks like TensorFlow
- Evaluate model performance on handwritten and printed character data

## Data and Validation

There is an additional folder/file named **`dev-test`**, which contains sample graphics and handwritten text used for validating the OCR models.

## File Structure

- `Building an mini-batch AI-Powered OCR Application with Neural Networks from Scratch NumPy vs TensorFlow.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, training, evaluation, and comparison.
- `dev-test/`: Contains handwritten and graphic images used for model testing and validation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the models.
4. Use images from the `dev-test` folder to test the OCR predictions.
